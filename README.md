# 🍝 Ristorante Ramos

**Ristorante Ramos** is a full–stack web application developed with **Django** as part of a higher–level project in Web Application Development (DAW).  
It simulates a complete restaurant management system with a professional structure, a modern front–end, and a robust database integration using **Oracle**.

This project showcases my skills in both front–end and back–end web development, following best practices in design, structure, and maintainability.

It includes customer–facing features such as viewing the menu, managing orders, adding reviews, and contacting the restaurant, as well as administrative panels for managing employees and products.

The design is responsive and visually appealing, implemented with **Bootstrap**, custom **CSS**, and reusable Django templates.
